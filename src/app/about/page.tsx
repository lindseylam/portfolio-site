                Hi! I'm Lindsey, an artist and storyteller based in New York. I work across multiple mediums, including writing, illustration, and comics. 
                My hobbies include reading, rock climbing, cat collecting & distributing, dog spotting, and staring longingly into the abyss until the abyss loves me back.
